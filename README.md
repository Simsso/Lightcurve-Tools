# Lightcurve-Tools
Two tools to work and experiment with lightcurves (**non production**).

##Lightcurve Generator
The Lightcurve Generator is a web tool which calculates [lightcurves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_curve) of either user defined binaries or .obj files. It's not fully working and not under development anymore. 

The screenshot shows the tool in use with a loaded .obj file.

##Lightcurves Blender
A small tool which draws a light curve out of an image set which renders an object over a whole rotation (360 deg). It's not required to work in combination with the free open-source software [Blender](http://www.blender.org) - but it's probably the easiest way to use it. Opposed to the prior tool this one is fully functional.
